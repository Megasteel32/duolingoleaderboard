### Duolingo Leaderboard
This entire site was written with 0 knowledge
of CSS or JavaScript (I know *some* HTML). I had Copilot and Claude.ai write everything, 
I just psuedocoded and instructed them. 
I have absolutely 0 intention on learning CSS or JavaScript,
and this is sort of a testament to why I don't need to. Fuck web development.
